 #Cyrodiil
 Titus_Mede_II_desc:0 "Crowned just three years prior, Emperor Titus Mede II inherited a weak and fractured Empire, consisting only of Cyrodiil, High Rock, Skyrim, and the civil war-ridden Hammerfell. Now, tensions are growing against the Aldmeri Dominion, and while the Empire is nowhere near its past size, Emperor Mede is determined to bring upon a new Imperial golden age. With a fractured Empire and a weakened military, only time will tell if the great Emperor will succeed."

 #Hammerfell
 Azacean_desc:0 "Azacean, High King of Hammerfell and leader of the Forebears, rules over his land and his people with an iron fist. Though as times goes by his grip is becoming weaker and weaker and his power slowly crumbles amidst the ongoing internal political conflict. Having not garnered neither popularity, nor support of the people, Azacean now relies completely on what small influence the Empire and the Emperor himself have in Hammerfell, and even more so on the power of the Imperial Legions still left in the province."

 #Pyandonea
 Orgnum_desc:0 "According to legend, Orgnum was a phenomenally wealthy Aldmer nobleman, who used his finances to launch a rebellion against the powers of the land. He and his followers were banished for this to a place separated from Aldmeris by an impenetrable mist, Pyandonea. Orgnum has personally led several invading fleets against Alinor, most notably in 3E 110, where Orgnum's grand armada was brutally destroyed by the Imperial Navy and the Psijic Order. For as long as Man has known it, Pyandonea has been ruled by the iron fist of King Orgnum, and with no signs of his immortality coming to an end, it seems as if his rule will continue for quite some time."
