 #Cyrodiil
 Titus_Mede_II_desc:0 "Crowned just three years prior, Emperor Titus Mede II inherited a weak and fractured Empire, consisting only of Cyrodiil, High Rock, Skyrim, and the civil war-ridden Hammerfell. Now, tensions are growing against the Aldmeri Dominion, and while the Empire is nowhere near its past size, Emperor Mede is determined to bring upon a new Imperial golden age. With a fractured Empire and a weakened military, only time will tell if the great Emperor will succeed."

 #Hammerfell
 Azacean_desc:0 "Azacean, High King of Hammerfell and leader of the Forebears, rules over his land and his people with an iron fist. Though as times goes by his grip is becoming weaker and weaker and his power slowly crumbles amidst the ongoing internal political conflict. Having not garnered neither popularity, nor support of the people, Azacean now relies completely on what small influence the Empire and the Emperor himself have in Hammerfell, and even more so on the power of the Imperial Legions still left in the province."

 #Pyandonea
 Orgnum_desc:0 "According to legend, Orgnum was a phenomenally wealthy Aldmer nobleman, who used his finances to launch a rebellion against the powers of the land. He and his followers were banished for this to a place separated from Aldmeris by an impenetrable mist, Pyandonea. Orgnum has personally led several invading fleets against Alinor, most notably in 3E 110, where Orgnum's grand armada was brutally destroyed by the Imperial Navy and the Psijic Order. For as long as Man has known it, Pyandonea has been ruled by the iron fist of King Orgnum, and with no signs of his immortality coming to an end, it seems as if his rule will continue for quite some time."

 #House Dres
 Veneval_Dres_desc:0 "Having taken the position of Grandmaster of House Dres not too long after the awful events of Red Year and even more awful events of the War of Ascension, Veneval Dres has dedicated all of his life to keeping what was left of the Great House together. Thanks to him Dres managed to keep their seat at the Grand Council and started to slowly recover from first terrifying years of the Fourth Era. However in year 171 of the Fourth Era Grandmaster Veneval is but a mere shadow of his former self, sick and bedridden, and talks about his successor are plaguing the House."
 Lloros_Dres_desc:0 "Lloros was born just a few years before the Red Year and with his own eyes witnessed the Argonian invasion take place. Horrifying images of slaughtered Dunmer and burning villages and towns were then forever engraved in his young mind, now fueling his never-ending hate towards the lizard-like people of the marshes. By 4E 163 Lloros had already managed to gather around him a group of prominent Dunmer nobles, who shared his hate and desire for revenge against the Argonians, and was openly vying for power inside the Great House. But it was only after the death of Grandmaster Veneval Dres in 4E 171 that he had a chance to get such power, and Lloros took this chance. Now he will use everything and everyone he has to enact his long-awaited revenge."
 
 #House Indoril
 Mendyn_Indoril_desc:0 "Mendyn Indoril has been in the Grandmaster's position for more than a hundred years already and through all of this time he was doing everything he could to restore his Grand Houses' position after the fall of the Tribunal. Back then he gave his full support to the New Temple and helped them spread their words and recruit people to serve the Reclamations, but now this past investment has come to bite Mendyn. The clergy is growing stronger and stronger, rivaling him in power and plotting in the shadows of the temples. The Grandmaster has to show his strength and rein in the priests, or his rule in Mournhold might come to an end." 
 
 #House Redoran
 Felseth_Redoran_desc:0 "After assuming the title of Grandmaster of House Redoran, Felseth has been continuing his predecessor's rather unorthodox politics in an attempt to keep his House's leading position in Morrowind. These politics, though efficient, ended up being unpopular among many of Redoran's minor houses and caused them to band together against the Grandmaster. In 4E 171 Felseth Redoran faces fierce opposition from those houses, who now call themselves Honorbounds, and has to act very carefully not to enrage them even more. But this situation can not stay for much longer and Grandmaster will have to make a move soon to secure his reign."
 
 #House Sadras
 Gaelion_Sadras_desc:0 "Gaelion Sadras was the first Dunmer of House Sadras to get the title of Grandmaster and kept this title ever since then. Troughout the years Gaelion maneuvered between the other Grandmasters, taking every chance he could to stabilise his own House's position and build up trust with others. All the while he was just as occupied with internal problems, as remnants of House Hlaalu roamed in his own lands. In most recent years Grandmaster managed to finally pacify the most vocal and problematic in his realm, but this stability can only be maintained for so long. Gaelion Sadras needs to keep his House's honor and position secure no matter the cost."
 
 #House Telvanni
 Irvalam_Telvanni_desc:0 "Irvalam Telvanni, Grandmaster and Archmagister of Great House Telvanni is one of the youngest in the House, yet holds these titles without any doubt from other Wizard Lords. Irvalam ascended to his position just before the Red Year and did his best to save the House during the horrible events that took place then. While those attempts proved unsuccessful, Telvanni still managed to recover in the years to come under Irvalam's leadership. More than a hundred years later Grandmaster is still in his position and rules from his estate without any open opposition. Some could say that this is a mark of a good ruler, but they would be far from truth."
