 Azacean_desc:0 "Azacean, High King of Hammerfell and leader of the Forebears, rules over his land and his people with an iron fist. Though as times goes by his grip is becoming weaker and weaker and his power slowly crumbles amidst the ongoing internal political conflict. Having not garnered neither popularity, nor support of the people, Azacean now relies completely on what small influence the Empire and the Emperor himself have in Hammerfell, and even more so on the power of the Imperial Legions still left in the province."
