As the main yes-man for his father's policies in the Elder Council, Ticellus is universally despised by most people and even council members. Despite this, the Emperor has continued to back his son, who is certain to provide great power for the regime if appointed as High Chancellor."

As part of an exile Altmer family, Ocato is a militant advocate of action against the Aldmeri Dominion, accusing them of organizing the murder of his great grandfather.

As a member of a prominent merchant family, Amaund Motierre has made a name for himself in fighting for the economic rights of the people of Cyrodiil, often defying the Emperor's policies while at it. Using populist rhetoric, Motierre has been able to gather a wide following, and isn't afraid to do what needs to be done for his people. Despite his youth, Motierre is a high-profile candidate for High Chancellor, a position which he'd certainly use to weaken the power of the Emperor, but the wide support from the populace would bring the Empire together."

Eager to augment their martial skills beyond the traditional methods of Skyrim, they excel in all manner of warfare. Above all else in Nord culture is the quest for honor and glory, and a great emphasis is placed on family values. They thrive in the cold, reminiscent of their native Atmora, and are known as a militant people by their neighbors. Nords are also naturally superior at sea, and have benefited from nautical trade since their first migrations across the sea from Atmora."

It is suggested that they may also carry Aldmer blood, which would further account for their magical prowess."
 idea_dunmer:0 "Dunmer"
 idea_dunmer_desc:0 "The Dunmer, more commonly known as Dark Elves, are the grey-skinned elven natives of the province of Morrowind. After the eruption of Red Mountain, many Dunmer fled to Skyrim, where they have endured extreme prejudice as a result of their elven heritage and status as refugees. In spite of this, many Dunmer have been able to establish themselves in Tamriel's northernmost province as skillful merchants and mages."

They have developed immunities to the diseases that have doomed many would-be explorers in the region, and they are capable of easily exploring underwater locations due to their ability to breathe underwater. Argonians make proficient thieves, due to their increased lockpicking and sneaking skills."

 idea_khajiit_desc:0 "Khajiit are one of the beast races which inhabit the continent of Tamriel, primarily their home province of Elsweyr. They are known for their natural agility, stealth, and their production of moon sugar, which can be refined into skooma. They travel around selling their wares but are not usually trusted, due to the racial prejudice of many of the races in Tamriel, resulting possibly from the belief that most Khajiit are thieves. They usually talk about themselves in the third person."
 idea_altmer:0 "Altmer"
 idea_altmer_desc:0 "Altmer are the light-skinned and tall Elves of the Summerset Isles. In the Empire, the name High Elves is given to the Altmer, with the word High being used to describe the Altmer as tall, proud, and culturally snobbish. The Altmer consider themselves the perfect race."

 idea_redguard_desc:0 "The Redguards are a race of humans who hail from the lost continent of Yokuda and now reside primarily in the province of Hammerfell. Due to their swift and decisive conquest of Hammerfell, the Redguards are renowned as some of the most naturally gifted warriors in Tamriel. Their ferocity and versatility is also manifested in their personality, which lends itself to why they are most effective as scouts and in small units as opposed to being deployed as rank and file soldiers."

Orsimer are of Elven blood, but this heritage is either not recognized or is forgotten by many in Tamriel.

 eight_divines_desc:0 "The original pantheon of Divines under the Alessian Empire, consisting of Akatosh, Arkay, Dibella, Julianos, Kynareth, Mara, Stendarr, and Zenithar. Worship of the Eight Divines was introduced by Alessia at the start of the First Era. It was a carefully designed compromise between the Aldmeri deities that the humans of Cyrodiil were accustomed to worshipping and the deities of Alessia's Nordic allies Following the deification of Tiber Septim, Talos was added to the pantheon and they became the Nine Divines."
 nine_divines:0 "Nine Divines"

 nordic_pantheon:0 "Nordic Pantheon"
 nordic_pantheon_desc:0 "The Nordic pantheon of Skyrim has many similar gods to that of Cyrodiil, with obvious name similarities between the two pantheons. However, the Nordic representations are almost always more warlike than their Cyrodiilic counterparts. The pantheon consists of Alduin, Kyne, Orkney, Shor, Stuhn, Tsun, Jhunal, Mara and Dibella. Unlike most pantheons, the Nordic gods are not led by the Dragon God of Time. Instead, Alduin is seen as the wellspring of the pantheon, rather than its leader. Some consider Kyne to be the head of the pantheon, who is one of the hearth gods."
 altmeri_pantheon:0 "Altmeri Pantheon"
 altmeri_pantheon_desc:0 "The Altmeri Pantheon is the set of gods worshiped by the Altmer. Derived from Aldmer ancestor worship, it focuses on a select group of spirits from which all Altmer claim descent. The pantheon consists of Auri-El, Trinimac, Magnus, Syrabane, Y'ffre, Mara and Xarxes. Merish religion is more focused towards their ancestors than other pantheons, evidenced by the use of the term Aedra (our ancestors) to describe them."

 new_temple_desc:0 "The New Temple is the Dunmeri religious order that was formed after the fall of the Tribunal and the second eruption of Red Mountain, better known as the Red Year. The temple reinstated the worship of the old Dunmeri Pantheon which included the Daedric Princes, Boethiah, Azura and Mephala. These three deities are known to the temple as the Reclamations, as if reclaiming their status."
 the_hist:0 "The Hist"
 the_hist_desc:0 "The Hist are a species of giant spore trees growing in the innermost swamps of Black Marsh. Argonians are known to have deep connections with the Hist, calling themselves people of the root, and licking the leaking sap of their trunks in religious rites. Others claim the trees are, in fact, a sentient race, more ancient than all the races of man and mer. Hist trees usually have red bioluminescent flowers growing out of them, but the Naga-Kur tribe have blue flowers. One tribe dedicated to ice spells have a Hist that drips with icicles and is said to be located deep within Black Marsh."

 orcish_pantheon:0 "Orcish Pantheon"
 orcish_pantheon_desc:0 "Orcs typically worship Malacath, the changed remnant of Trinimac, and his code informs much of their law and practices. Malacath is occasionally also called Mauloch, in this context. In the Third Era the orc chief Gortwog established a separate priesthood for Trinimac directly in his Orsinium. This was viewed as heresy by most orcs outside Orsinium and a minority within it, and a bad omen for orcs as a whole."
 redguard_pantheon:0 "Redguard Pantheon"
 redguard_pantheon_desc:0 "The Redguard pantheon is very different to most others, although again comparisons can be drawn between some gods, most notably Sep and Lorkhan. Where most cultures start with Anu and Padomay, Yokudan faith starts with one, Satakal, the World-Skin. They also believe their gods were tricked into becoming mortal, in the same way to most merish belief, and consider it their birthright to return to the Far Shores, the world beyond Mundus. Yokudan belief holds special reverence to the stars, believing them to be the way back to the Far Shores, although they do not acknowledge the Magna-Ge as distinct from the rest of their pantheon, and it is Tu'Wacca, their god of death, who helps them get there, not any kind of equivalent to Magnus. Where Imperial culture has Shezarr as a god of human achievement, and the Nords have Shor, the Yokudans have the Hoon'Ding, the Make Way God, who comes at a time of crisis to make way for his people. He has historically materialized as a variety of things, such as a sword, a crown or both."

The navy followed the ships through uncharted waters, into an ambush in Pyandonea itself. Most of the Alinor navy was destroyed, but a single warship returned to Summerset to describe the land as a sea jungle. Massive plateaus spilling over with vegetation form mazes around valleys of ocean. Waving tendrils of kelp trap all but the Maormer's own ships, and provide a well-camouflaged home for the sea serpents that are Orgnum's guards and occasional mounts.
