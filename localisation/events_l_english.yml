 #Great War
 great_war.1.t:0 "Aldmeri Ultimatum"
 great_war.1.d:0 "On orders from the Thalmor, the ambassador from the Aldmeri Dominion has now delivered an ultimatum to our state. If the conditions are not accepted, a state of war will be declared. The conditions are as follows: \n\nThe cession of Southern Hammerfell to the Dominion\nDisbandment of the Blades\nProhibition of Talos worship across the entire Empire"
 great_war.1.a:0 "We don't have a choice, do we?"
 great_war.1.b:0 "Elven scum! For the Empire!"
 great_war.2.t:0 "Imperial Rejection"
 great_war.2.d:0 "Despite our ambassador's peaceful attempt to deliver our ultimatum, the Imperials slaughtered him like a dog and refused our just terms. The situation is increasingly looking like a war with the Empire is on the horizon. This will be a war of Men and Mer, and Mer shall prevail!"
 great_war.2.a:0 "Fools!"
 great_war.3.t:0 "Emperor Cedes Southern Hammerfell"
 great_war.3.d:0 "After a ridiculous ultimatum was delivered to the Imperial City from the Aldmeri Dominion, the Emperor has decided to break. In the new White-Gold Concordat treaty, Southern Hammerfell shall be ceded to the Dominion. Many are calling this the ultimate betrayal, and for Hammerfell to resist any attempt to take our land."
 great_war.3.a:0 "We will be back!"
 great_war.3.b:0 "Nothing will be ceded."
 great_war.4.t:0 "Empire Accepts Ultimatum"
 great_war.4.d:0 "The Emperor has seen logic, and accepted our fair terms. Southern Hammerfell is being transferred to us as we speak by the disappointed Redguards, and a ban on Talos worship is being enforced in the provinces of the Empire. Mer wins once more!"
 great_war.4.a:0 "Unexpected."
 great_war.5.t:0 "Empire Accepts Ultimatum, Redguards Resist"
 great_war.5.d:0 "The Emperor has seen logic, and accepted our fair terms. While a ban on Talos worship is being enforced in the provinces of the Empire, the Redguards seem less accepting of the treaty. With the Redguards resisting our attempts to take control of Southern Hammerfell, the Emperor has renounced Hammerfell as an Imperial Province. It is now up to our troops to finish the Redguards."
 great_war.5.a:0 "Redguard fools!"
 great_war.6.t:0 "Signing the White-Gold Concordat"
 great_war.6.d:0 "After diplomatic talks with the Dominion for a lasting peace, a treaty known as the White-Gold Concordat has now been drafted. The treaty stipulates that Talos worship is banned throughout the Empire, and that Southern Hammerfell will be ceded to the Aldmeri Dominion."
 great_war.6.a:0 "We had no choice."
 great_war.7.t:0 "Hammerfell Rejects Concordat"
 great_war.7.d:0 "With our decision to solve the Dominion issue diplomatically, Hammerfell has made it explicitly clear that no land will be ceded. This conflicts directly with the treaty, and it is now clear that the Redguards will not cooperate. We can now either keep the Redguards loyal and fight the Dominion, or leave Hammerfell alone against the Dominion. Which is it?"
 great_war.7.a:0 "Hammerfell are our brothers!"
 great_war.7.b:0 "We cannot afford a war."
 great_war.8.t:0 "EMPIRE-DOMINION TREATY!"
 great_war.8.d:0 "After facing pressure from all sides, Emperor Titus Mede II has decided to sign a treaty with the Aldmeri Dominion. The reasoning is unclear, but is suspected to be avoiding further bloodshed between the 2 powers. Treaty conditions stipulate the total ban on Talos worship within the Empire, likely to anger Skyrim, and the cession of Southern Hammerfell, something the Redguards will hardly accept."
 great_war.8.a:0 "A lasting peace!"
 great_war.8.b:0 "We will return."
 great_war.8.c:0 "We did what we had to."
 
 #Skyrim
 skyrim.1.t:0 "Death of High King Istlod"
 skyrim.1.d:0 "After having ruled Skyrim valiantly for 25 years, taking the province through turbulent times, and preventing chaos during the Great War, High King Istlod today passed away peacefully. Skyrim mourns as funeral preparations take place in Solitude, and Torygg, son of the late High King, has taken the throne and will now lead Skyrim into uncertain times."
 skyrim.1.a:0 "Rest in peace, High King!"
 skyrim.2.t:0 "Ulfric Stormcloak challenges High King Torygg"
 skyrim.2.d:0 "It was a normal morning, until Jarl of Eastmarch, Ulfric Stormcloak marched into Solitude, and challenged the humble High King Torygg to a duel. Torygg accepted the request honourably, however when the duel started, Ulfric turned out to have a trick up his sleve. After studying with the Greybeards, Ulfric learned the ability to use Dragon Shouts. This turned out to give him a radical advantage against Torygg, and the High King was shouted to the ground and killed."
 skyrim.2.a:0 "Horrible murder!"
 skyrim.3.t:0 "The Stormcloak Rebellion"
 skyrim.3.d:0 "After murdering High King Torygg in Solitude, Jarl of Eastmarch, Ulfric Stormcloak has called an uprising against the Empire. The rebellion has been joined by the Old Holds: Eastmarch, Winterhold, The Rift and The Pale, and is openly challenging Imperial authority in Skyrim."
 skyrim.3.a:0 "For the Empire!"
 skyrim.3.b:0 "Skyrim belongs to the Nords! (Play as the Stormcloaks)"
 skyrim.4.t:0 "General Tullius arrives in Solitude"
 skyrim.4.d:0 "With the murder of High King Torygg, the Emperor has sent the one and only General Tullius to Solitude to restore order. Tullius vows to command Imperial forces to crush the Stormcloak Rebellion, and to keep order in Skyrim until the now widowed Jarl Elisif can become High Queen of Skyrim."
 skyrim.4.a:0 "The man we need to stop Ulfric."
 skyrim.5.t:0 "The Moot"
 skyrim.5.d:0 "With the Skyrim Civil War resolved in our favour, it is time to hold the Moot, and elect a new High King or Queen. The obvious candidate is Jarl Elisif the Fair of Haafingar, widow of the late High King Torygg."
 skyrim.5.a:0 "Jarl Elisif the Fair will lead."
 skyrim.6.t:0 "CIVIL WAR IN SKYRIM!"
 skyrim.6.d:0 "After Jarl of Eastmarch, Ulfric Stormcloak, marched into Solitude and murdered High King Torygg, conflict was inevitable. It has now arrived, with Ulfric declaring a rebellion against Imperial rule in Skyrim. Ulfric has been joined by the Old Holds of Winterhold, The Rift and The Pale, as well as his own Eastmarch. The uprising is opposed by newly-arrived General Tullius of the Imperial Legion, who has gathered Legion forces to battle the Stormcloaks."

 forsworn_uprising.1.d:0 "With most available Legions diverted to fighting the Aldmeri Dominion, the native Bretons of the Reach have taken the initiative, and declared independence from Skyrim. The Reachmen under King Madanach have taken control of settlements and military installations in the area, and until the war is over, we will not be able to reclaim the Reach."

 forsworn_uprising.2.d:0 "With most available Legions diverted to fighting the Aldmeri Dominion, the native Bretons of the Reach have taken the initiative, and declared independence from Skyrim. The Reachmen under King Madanach have taken control of settlements and military installations in the area, and with all resources devoted to fighting the Dominion, the Reach is likely to remain independent until the end of the war."
 forsworn_uprising.2.a:0 "A worrying development!"
 forsworn_uprising.2.b:0 "The Reach is ours!"

 whiterun.1.d:0 "After intense debate within the Jarl's Court, local businessman Nazeem was today appointed as Economic Advisor to the Jarl. Nazeem, owner of Chillfurrow Farm, is notorous for having insulted innocent travellers for not having been to the Cloud District. In a recent poll, he was voted the most hated person of Whiterun, and many people are voicing their opposition to his ascension to the Cloud District. Will our Whiterun be polarized forever?"
