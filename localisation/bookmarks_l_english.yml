 OTHER_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Oblivion Crisis, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."

 #The Great War
 GREAT_WAR_NAME:0 "The Great War"
 GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The Thalmor-ruled Third Aldmeri Dominion is preparing to take on the remainder of the unstable Cyrodiilic Empire, now under Titus Mede II. Will Mer triumph over Man in total war, or shall the Empire triumph once more? Take charge of one of the two giants and win the coming Great War, or head into the new era as one of the newly independent regional powers, such as An-Xileel-ruled Argonia, or one of the Houses of Morrowind. Perhaps head East, and take control of one of the 4 civilisations of Akavir? The choice is yours."

 CYR_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Just over 171 years ago, Martin Septim's sacrifice ended the Oblivion Crisis and prevented the total destruction of Tamriel, however also ending the Septim dynasty. In the immediate aftermath, the provinces of Summerset, Morrowind and Black Marsh broke away from the Empire. Years later, Thalmor agents assassinated Potentate Ocato and threw the Empire into chaos, letting them overthrow Imperial rule in Valenwood and Elsweyr. After the chaos, warlord Titus Mede ended up in control and crowned himself Emperor, later handing the reigns to his son. Tiber Septim's empire is today a mere shadow of its former self, but the future remains unknown."

 ALD_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Reeling from the combined might of the Mythic Dawn and their Daedric allies in the Oblivion Crisis, the Altmer leadership gave power to the Thalmor, a radical faction who espoused secession from the Empire. Under Thalmor leadership, the Altmer successfully fought off the Daedra until the end of the Crisis, and renamed the province Alinor. The Thalmor took advantage of the weakened Empire, and through diplomacy and subversion managed to gain control of the provinces of Valenwood and Elsweyr. What the Dominion is currently up to remains unknown, but confrontation with the Empire seems increasingly inevitable."

 DRS_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "House Dres is one of five Great Houses of Morrowind, ruling over the land's most southern territories, more specifically Deshaan Plains. Infamous for it's vast saltrice plantations filled to the brim with Khajiit and Argonian slaves, House Dres was Morrowind's agricultural center for centuries. However, after the Red Year , House Dres is but a mere shadow of it's former self. With only small portion of its rightful lands under control, with no slaves to fuel the plantations and with internal strife plaguing the House elite, House Dres now finds itself in a most sad position as the undoubted underdog of Morrowind. Could things change in the near future?"

 SAD_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The youngest and least influential of all five Great Houses of Morrowind, House Sadras seems to be one of the more stable, though one of the less important as well. Despite taking House Hlaalu's place on the Grand Council, House Sadras hasn't been able to truly show itself yet. Not much is known about its history, but maybe the future will finally see House Sadras firmly establish itself in the Grand Council."

 TEL_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The most isolationist of all Great Houses of Morrowind, House Telvanni rules over the Eastern Mountains and islands of the land. With its famous mages, bizarre mushroom-houses and strange laws and traditions, it is one of the most known. At the same time Telvanni were hit the most out of the stronger Great Houses, but despite it they still managed to keep their position. It seems there isn't much change coming to the House of Telvanni, with most supposedly content with the current state of affairs. However, maybe the enigmatic Lords and Magisters of the Great House have something bigger in mind?"

 IDR_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "One of the five Great Houses of Morrowind, House Indoril is the most religious and conservative of them all, ruling over the central territories of Morrowind on the eastern bank of Thirr from the glorious city of Mournhold, former capital of the land. Always connected to the Temple in the past, Indoril still maintains this connection to this day with most of the priests and Ordinators of The Reclamations being from House Indoril. Hit hard during the aftermath of the Red Year and Argonian invasion, Indoril still stays vigilant and faithful. And though it may face troubles, those loyal know that House of the great hero Nerevar can never fall."
 
 RED_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "Now the strongest Great House of Morrowind and the undisputed leader of the Grand Council, House Redoran lords over the Velothi Mountains and the surrounding territories in peace. After saving the Dunmer during the Argonian Invasion, Redoran rose to heights never seen before, but this rise and the situation around also forced them to change their politics and adapt. This change wasn't taken kindly by all in the House and internal opposition to the Grandmaster grows stronger with each passing year, amassing more and more nobles that are discontent with Felseth's agenda under the banner of the Honorbounds."
