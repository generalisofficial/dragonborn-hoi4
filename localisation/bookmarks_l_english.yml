 #The Great War
 GREAT_WAR_NAME:0 "The Great War"
 GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The Thalmor-ruled Third Aldmeri Dominion is preparing to take on the remainder of the unstable Cyrodiilic Empire, now under Titus Mede II. Will Mer triumph over Man in total war, or shall the Empire triumph once more? Take charge of one of the two giants and win the coming Great War, or head into the new era as one of the newly independent regional powers, such as An-Xileel-ruled Argonia, or one of the Houses of Morrowind. Perhaps head East, and take control of one of the 4 civilisations of Akavir? The choice is yours."
 DRS_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "House Dres is one of five Great Houses of Morrowind, ruling over the land's most southern territories, more specifically Deshaan Plains. For centuries this House has been one of the most traditional among others, supporting the Temple, but also remembering many of the Dunmer's ancient traditions. Infamous for it's vast saltrice plantations filled to the brim with Khajiit and Argonian slaves, House Dres was Morrowind's agricultural center for almost all of its history. However, after the Eruption of Red  Mountain, the Oblivion Crisis and the following Argonian Invasion, House Dres is but a mere shadow of it's former self. With only small portion of it's rightful lands under control, with no slaves to fuel the plantations and with internal strife plaguing the House elite, House Dres now finds itself in a most sad position as the  undoubted underdog of Morrowind. But could things change in the near future?"
