 OTHER_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Oblivion Crisis, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."

 #The Great War
 GREAT_WAR_NAME:0 "The Great War"
 GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The Thalmor-ruled Third Aldmeri Dominion is preparing to take on the remainder of the unstable Cyrodiilic Empire, now under Titus Mede II. Will Mer triumph over Man in total war, or shall the Empire triumph once more? Take charge of one of the two giants and win the coming Great War, or head into the new era as one of the newly independent regional powers, such as An-Xileel-ruled Argonia, or one of the Houses of Morrowind. Perhaps head East, and take control of one of the 4 civilisations of Akavir? The choice is yours."

 DRS_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "House Dres is one of five Great Houses of Morrowind, ruling over the land's most southern territories, more specifically Deshaan Plains. For centuries this House has been one of the most traditional among others, supporting the Temple, but also remembering many of the Dunmer's ancient traditions. Infamous for it's vast saltrice plantations filled to the brim with Khajiit and Argonian slaves, House Dres was Morrowind's agricultural center for almost all of its history. However, after the Eruption of Red  Mountain, the Oblivion Crisis and the following Argonian Invasion, House Dres is but a mere shadow of it's former self. With only small portion of it's rightful lands under control, with no slaves to fuel the plantations and with internal strife plaguing the House elite, House Dres now finds itself in a most sad position as the  undoubted underdog of Morrowind. But could things change in the near future?"

 SAD_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The youngest and least influential of all five Great Houses of Morrowind, House Sadras seems to be one of the more stable, though one of the less important as well. Despite taking House Hlaalu's place on the Grand Council, House Sadras hasn't been able to truly show itself yet. Not much is known about its history, but maybe the future will finally see House Sadras firmly establish itself in the Grand Council."

 TEL_GREAT_WAR_DESC:0 "The most isolationist of all Great Houses of Morrowind, House Telvanni rules over the Eastern Mountains and islands of the land. With its famous mages and other eccentric individuals, bizarre mushroom-houses and strange laws and traditions, it is one of the most known. At the moment it is one of the stronger Houses, having not suffered much during the Red Year and the Argonian invasion of Morrowind. There isn't much change coming to the House, with everyone seemingly content with the current state of affairs. However, maybe the Lords and Magisters have something greater for their Great House in mind?"
