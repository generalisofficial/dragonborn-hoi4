 #Topal Island Dispute
 topal_island_dispute:0 "Status of Topal Island"
 topal_island_dispute_desc:0 "We have for long maintained a claim to Topal Island, due to its militarily strategic location at the center of Topal Bay. This puts us at odds with the government in Cyrodiil, who claims the island as an integral part of their realm. If the opportunity arises, there is the possibility of seizing the island. Alternatively, we could drop our claims to the island, in order to improve relations with Cyrodiil."
 seize_topal_island:0 "Seize Topal Island"

 recognize_reachman_independence:0 "Recognize Reachman Independence"
 recognize_reachman_independence_desc:0 "We are not ready for a confrontation with the Reachmen. As they have already shown, they will defend the Reach to the last man.
