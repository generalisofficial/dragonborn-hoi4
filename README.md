HOI4 Dragonborn mod - Official Development Repository

Dragonborn is an ambitious project to have a Hearts of Iron IV Mod set on the planet of Nirn, from the popular video game series "the Elder Scrolls". 
The new in-game custom map includes Tamriel, Atmora, Akavir and Pyandonea, and is set during the eventful Fourth Era, with several major military conflicts breaking out across Tamriel. 
Conquer and explore the provinces of Tamriel, including Skyrim, Cyrodiil and Morrowind, or head over to Akavir, and take charge of civilisations such as the Tsaesci, Ka Po Tun or the Kamal.
