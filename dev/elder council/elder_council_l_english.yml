For a long time since the days of Pelagius Septim II, it has consisted of the wealthiest men and women in the Empire. The Council would lose their authority over the Emperor under the efforts of Emperor Uriel VI and Empress Morihatha, resulting in the Emperor being permitted to rule directly, with the Elder Council holding additional power."
