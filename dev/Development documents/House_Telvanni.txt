House Telvanni:

Background:

The most isolationist of all Great Houses of Morrowind, House Telvanni rules over the Eastern Mountains and islands of the land. With it's famous mages and other eccentric individuals, bizarre mushroom-houses and weird laws and traditions, it is one of the most known. And at the moment it is one of the stronger Houses, having not suffered much during the Red Year and the argonian invasion of Morrowind, Telvanni to this day maintain their isolation.
And there isn't much change coming to the House it seems, since seemingly everyone is content with it's current state. But maybe the Lords and Magisters have something greater for their Great House in mind?

Ideologies:

Isolationist Leader: Irvalam Telvanni (Leader at Game Start) https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer_Names

Internationalist Leader: Fenus Hlervi (Random Male Dunmer Name) https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer_Names

Jingoist Leader: Tireso Volos (Random Male Dunmer Name) https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer_Names

Pragmatic Leader: Bralen Romari (Random Male Dunmer Name) https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer_Names


Once again no information on the current leader of the House and any real figures within except for like Neloth. And, of course, the ruling party at the begining would be Isolationst, but also I'd say that Isolationsts are raelly the only possible party to rule the House.
So, yeah, all leaders are random dunmer names, except for the Isolationst party the leader of which gets the Telvanni family name. All leaders are Telvanni, since they are dunmer and generally more anti-outlander.

National Spirits:

Dunmer Revanchism.

Legacy of the Red Year.

Telvanni Magisters(A research buffs and maybe mage attack and defense buff for the future when we add mages I suppose)

The Law of Power(Like a stability buff, but maybe make it trigger negative events randomly like the vanilla romanian events with Carol II)

Well since all dunmer must have the Legacy of the Red Year national spirit and Dunmer Revanchism one, these are of course present.
For House Telvanni the two spirits were overall pretty obvious. So they are Telvanni Magisters and The Law of Power. First one is very simple. House Telvanni is the house of very powerful mages and various eccentric people that can be classified as researchers.
Second one is about the specifics of Telvanni culture and law. Or the fact that they generally believe that any Telvanni lord's words are laws within his domain. And if one is stronger and can get away with doing something, then he must have deserved to have done this.
