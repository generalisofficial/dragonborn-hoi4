House Indoril:

Background:

One of the five Great Houses of Morrowind, House Indoril is the most religious and conservative of them all, ruling over the central territories of Morrowind on the eastern bank of Thirr from the glorious city of Mournhold, former capital of the land. Always connected to the Temple in the past, Indoril still maintains this connection to this day with most of the priests and Ordinators of The Reclamations being from House Indoril.
Hit hard during the aftermath of the Red Year and argonian invasion, Indoril still stays as vigilant and faithful as ever. And though it may face troubles with clerics within the House growing ever more powerful by the day, those loyal know that House of the greatest dunmer hero Nerevar can never fall.


Ideologies:

Isolationist Leader: Mendyn Indoril (Leader at Game Start) https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer_Names

Internationalist Leader: Hlaren Vari (Random Male Dunmer Name) https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer_Names

Jingoist Leader: Drores Indoril (Random Male Dunmer Name) https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer_Names

Pragmatic Leader: Rararyn Seleth (Random Male Dunmer Name) https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer_Names

Once again no information on the current leader of the House or any notable figures within it at the time, so once again going with random names except for the Jingoist and Isolationist factions. Of course House Indoril would start off isolationst since that is literally what they are in the lore most of the time and now wouldn't be an exception.
I also think it would be interesting to have a more jingoist faction take power within the House, maybe the Temple higher-ups managing to get even closer to actual power and deciding to go on a little holy adventure, let's call it that. Oh, and all factions are led by dunmer, I don't suppose much explanation is needed at this point why.

National Spirits:

Dunmer Revanchism.

Legacy of the Red Year.

Justice Never Sleeps.(Some stability, spy detection buffs, maybe a special forces buff of sorts.)

Overwhelming Clerical Power. (Less political power and higher advisor costs I suppose.)

Well since all dunmer must have the Legacy of the Red Year national spirit and Dunmer Revanchism one, these are of course present.
For House Indoril I came up with their own special two national spirits. Justice Never Sleeps and Overwhelming Clerical Power. First one is about the famous Temple guardians, warriors and inquisitors - the Ordinators. Given how powerful, feared and respected they are and how actually good they are at fighting enemies of the Temple, criminals and heretics.
Given that I thought it would be necessary to have a spirit dedicated to them. Second one is Overhwleming Clerical Power. House Indoril has always been deeply connected to the Temple. Be it Tribunal or The Reclamations nowadays, Indoril is there to be the priests, the Ordinators and the theologists.
This, however, also means that those serving the Temple have a lot of influence inside the House and practically almost run it. The situation has it's effects and possible consequences.
