[b]Dragonborn[/b] is a new and ambitious total conversion project, aiming to have a Hearts of Iron IV Mod set on the planet of Nirn, from the popular fantasy video game series "the Elder Scrolls". The new in-game custom map includes Tamriel, Atmora, Akavir and Pyandonea. The mod is set during the eventful Fourth Era, with several major military conflicts breaking out across Tamriel. The mod contains every aspect of a total-overhaul mod, along with Elder Scrolls-themed in-game music.

[b]The Great War - Frost Fall, 4E 171[/b]
The Thalmor-ruled Third Aldmeri Dominion is preparing to take on the remainder of the unstable Cyrodiilic Empire, now under Emperor Titus Mede II, after the end of the Septim Dynasty in the Oblivion Crisis. Will Mer triumph over Man in total war, or shall the Empire triumph over the elves once more? Take charge of one of the two giants and win the coming Great War, or head into the new era as one of the newly independent regional powers, such as An-Xileel-ruled Argonia, or one of the Houses of Morrowind, such as Redoran, Telvanni, Indoril or Dres. Perhaps head East, and take control of one of the 4 civilisations of Akavir? The choice is yours.
